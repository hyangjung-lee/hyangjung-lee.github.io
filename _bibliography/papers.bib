  title={Corrective feedback guides human perceptual decision-making by informing about the world state rather than rewarding its choice},
  author={Lee, H.-J. and Lee, H. and Lim, C.Y. and Rhim, I. and Lee, S.-H.},
  abstract={Corrective feedback received on perceptual decisions is crucial for adjusting decision-making strategies to improve future choices. However, its complex interaction with other decision components, such as previous stimuli and choices, challenges a principled account of how it shapes subsequent decisions. One popular approach, based on animal behavior and extended to human perceptual decision-making, employs ‘reinforcement learning,’ a principle proven successful in reward-based decision-making. The core idea behind this approach is that decision-makers, although engaged in a perceptual task, treat corrective feedback as rewards from which they learn choice values. Here, we explore an alternative idea, which is that humans consider corrective feedback on perceptual decisions as evidence of the actual state of the world rather than as rewards for their choices. By implementing these ‘feedback-as-reward’ and ‘feedback-as-evidence’ hypotheses on a shared learning platform, we show that the latter outperforms the former in explaining how corrective feedback adjusts the decision-making strategy along with past stimuli and choices. Our work suggests that humans learn about what has happened in their environment rather than the values of their own choices through corrective feedback during perceptual decision-making.},

  title={Neural Evidence for Boundary Updating as the Source of the Repulsive Bias in Classification},
  author={Lee, H. and Lee, H.-J. and Choe, K.W. and and Lee, S.-H.},
  abstract={Binary classification, an act of sorting items into two classes by setting a boundary, is biased by recent history. One common form of such bias is repulsive bias, a tendency to sort an item into the class opposite to its preceding items. Sensory-adaptation and boundary-updating are considered as two contending sources of the repulsive bias, yet no neural support has been provided for either source. Here, we explored human brains of both men and women, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to find such support by relating the brain signals of sensory-adaptation and boundary-updating to human classification behavior. We found that the stimulus-encoding signal in the early visual cortex adapted to previous stimuli, yet its adaptation-related changes were dissociated from current choices. Contrastingly, the boundary-representing signals in the inferior-parietal and superior-temporal cortices shifted to previous stimuli and covaried with current choices. Our exploration points to boundary-updating, rather than sensory-adaptation, as the origin of the repulsive bias in binary classification.},

  title={Decision-consistent bias mediated by drift dynamics of human visual working memory},
  author={Gu, H. and Lee, J. and Kim, S. and Lim, J. and Lee, H.-J. and Lee, H. and Choe, M. and Yoo, D.-G. and Ryu, J.H. and Lim, S. and Lee, S.-H.},
  abstract={To adapt to dynamic surroundings, we need to reliably maintain sensory experiences while making accurate decisions about them. Nonetheless, humans tend to bias their ongoing actions toward their past decisions, a phenomenon dubbed decision-consistent bias. Efforts to explain this seemingly irrational bias have been limited to the sensory readout account. Here, by putting the bias in the context of mnemonic maintenance, we uncover its previously unidentified source: the interplay of decision-making with the drift dynamics of visual working memory. By taking behavioral snapshots of human visual working memory while concurrently tracking their cortical signals during a prolonged delay, we show that mnemonic representations transition toward a few stable points while initially biasing decisions and continuously drifting afterward in the direction consistent with the decisional bias. Task-optimized recurrent neural networks with drift dynamics reproduce the human data, offering a neural mechanism underlying the decision-consistent bias.},
