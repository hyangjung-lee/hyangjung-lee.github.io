I am a final-year PhD student studying computational cognitive neuroscience at <a href='https://en.snu.ac.kr'>Seoul National University</a> advised by  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oOGktdsAAAAJ'>Dr. Sang-Hun Lee</a>.  

Before that, I graduated from <a href='https://cls.snu.ac.kr/en/'>College of Liberal Studies</a> at Seoul National University with B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience and B.A. in Economics. 
<br>I conducted my undergraduate research at Eye Movement and Vision Research Laboratory, advised by <a href='https://neurotree.org/beta/peopleinfo.php?pid=1137'>Dr. Choongkil Lee</a>. I spent time at Magenetoencephalography center, Seoul National University Hospital, advised by <a href='https://snucm.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/y-chung-10'>Dr. Chun Kee Chung</a>. I also spent some time in the MRI Group in the Singapore Bioimgaing Consortium at Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), advised by <a href='https://qbi.uq.edu.au/profile/1225/kai-hsiang-chuang'>Dr. Kai-Hsiang Chuang</a>. 

My passion lies at the intersection of human and machine intelligence, with an emphasis on structured knowledge, learning, and decision-making, including perceptual and causal judgments. 

During my PhD, I focus on corrective feedback, particularly in the context of perceptual decision-making. 
<br>I develop models using Bayesian decision theory and reinforcement learning to emulate human-like behavior. My research goal is to uncover human learning from feedback, to gain a deeper understanding of complex human intelligence by investigating the richness of its behavior, and ultimately to work towards building artificial intelligent systems that have the potential to empower individuals by incorporating their biological aspects, such as the brain and physiology.
