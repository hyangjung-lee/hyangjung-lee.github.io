I am a final-year PhD student studying computational neuroscience at <a href='https://en.snu.ac.kr'>Seoul National University</a> advised by  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oOGktdsAAAAJ'>Dr. Sang-Hun Lee</a>.  

Before that, I graduated from <a href='https://cls.snu.ac.kr/en/'>College of Liberal Studies</a> at Seoul National University with B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience and B.A. in Economics. 
<br>I conducted my undergraduate research at Eye Movement and Vision Research Laboratory, advised by <a href='https://neurotree.org/beta/peopleinfo.php?pid=1137'>Dr. Choongkil Lee</a>. I spent time at Magenetoencephalography center, Seoul National University Hospital, advised by <a href='https://snucm.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/y-chung-10'>Dr. Chun Kee Chung</a>. I also spent some time in the MRI Group in the Singapore Bioimgaing Consortium at Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), advised by <a href='https://qbi.uq.edu.au/profile/1225/kai-hsiang-chuang'>Dr. Kai-Hsiang Chuang</a>. 

My passion lies at the intersection of human and machine intelligence, with an emphasis on structured knowledge, learning, and decision-making. 

During my PhD, I focus on corrective feedback, particularly in the context of perceptual decision-making. 
<br>I develop models using Bayesian decision theory and reinforcement learning to emulate human-like choice behavior. My research goal is to gain a deeper understanding of complex human intelligence by integrating their biological aspects, including the brain and physiology, and ultimately working towards on building artificial intelligent systems that have the potential empower individuals.
